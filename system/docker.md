##### ENTRYPOINT vs CMD
- ENTRYPOINT is the fixed part of the command
- CMD is the variable part (usually the parameters)

##### EXEC vs SHELL form of ENTRYPOINT / CMD
- EXEC: JSON arrays, no variable substitution, command PID is 1, get unix signals directly (recommended)
- SHELL: `/bin/sh -c `

---

##### Multi-stage build
- Suited for compiled languages
- Minifying / transpiling dynamic languages in build stage
```
FROM golang:1.10 as builder
RUN go build src/*.go

FROM alpine:3.7
COPY --from=builder /go/src/app/main .
CMD ["./main"]
```

---

##### Mount sources
- Bind mounted sources when running the container
- Suited for dynamic languages
- No need to rebuild or restart container when sources are updated
```bash
docker run -v ${pwd}/src:/src
```

---

##### Clean up

```bash
# remove all exited containers
docker ps -aq --no-trunc -f status=exited | xargs docker rm
```

```bash
# remove all dangling/untagged images
docker images -q --filter dangling=true | xargs docker rmi
```
